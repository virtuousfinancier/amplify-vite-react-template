# Virtuous Finance - Options Volatility Surface Analyzer

## What This Software Does

This is a tool that helps investors and financial professionals analyze stock options. It creates visual displays of important options trading information, specifically something called "volatility surfaces" which help traders understand how the market views risk across different time periods.

Think of it like a weather map for the stock market - just like a weather map shows you where it might rain or be sunny, our tool shows you where the market expects more or less price movement in options.

## Main Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Shows you up-to-the-minute options information from the stock market
- **Easy-to-Read Visuals**: Displays complex market data in a clear, color-coded format
- **Professional-Grade Analysis**: Uses the same type of analysis tools that professional traders use
- **Works on Any Device**: Whether you're using a computer, tablet, or phone, the display adjusts to fit your screen

## How to Use It

1. Enter a stock symbol (like AAPL for Apple or MSFT for Microsoft)
2. Click the "Fetch Data" button
3. View the color-coded table that appears
   - Blue means lower volatility (market expects less price movement)
   - Red means higher volatility (market expects more price movement)
   - Brighter colors mean stronger expectations

## What You'll See

The tool shows you a table with:
- Different prices (called "strikes") down the left side
- Different dates (expiration dates) across the top
- Colors in each cell showing how much movement the market expects
- A highlighted row showing the current stock price
